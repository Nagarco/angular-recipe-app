## Features

The Angular Recipe App includes the following features:
 * Structural Directives:
   - **ngIf**: Used to conditionally render elements based on a condition.
   - **ngFor**: Used to iterate over a collection and render elements.

 * Property and Event Binding:
    - **Property Binding**: Used to bind component properties to HTML element attributes or directives.
    - **Event Binding**: Used to bind HTML element events to component methods.

* ViewChild:
   - **ViewChild**: Used to access and manipulate DOM elements or child components.
  
* Lifecycle Hooks:
    - **OnInit**: Used to perform initialization tasks in a component after data binding.

* Custom Directives:
   - **Custom Directives**: Used to conditionally render elements based on a condition.

* HostListener, HostBinding, Renderer Method:
    - **HostListener**: Used to listen to DOM events on host elements.
    - **HostBinding**: Used to bind properties of the host element.
    - **Renderer Method**: Used to modify the DOM elements.

* Services and Dependency Injection:
    - **Services**: Used to encapsulate reusable business logic and data.
    - **Dependency Injection**: Used to provide instances of services to components.

* Routing:
    - **Routing**: Used to implement navigation and multiple views within the application.

* HTTP Client Module and Firebase Integration:
  - **HTTP Client Module**: Utilized for handling CRUD operations within the app.
  - **Firebase Integration**: Integrated with Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.

* Forms Module:
  - **Reactive Forms**: Used the Reactive Forms approach for handling forms.
  - **Template-Driven Forms**: Implemented forms using the template-driven approach.

* Observables for Component Communication:
  - **Observables**: Utilized Observables to pass data between components. Subscribed to these observables to enable efficient and responsive communication between different parts of the application.
  - **Operators (map, tap)**: Used operators like map to transform the data and tap to perform side effects such as logging during the observable pipeline
